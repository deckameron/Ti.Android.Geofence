## startMonitoring

This method will check your geofences and start monitoring for the transitions you want. Once you use this method, the fences will be monitored until told otherwise. Your fences will be re-added whenever the user restarts it phone or change the location provider.

## clearExistingFences

This method will clear all existing fences already being monitored. It will also stop the monitoring service.

## stopMonitoring

This method will just stop the monitoring service for the current fences. It will NOT clear the existing fences already being monitored.
