 * Single Window Application Template:
 * A basic starting point for your application.  Mostly a blank canvas.

 * In app.js, we generally take care of a few things:
 * - Bootstrap the application with any data we need
 * - Check for dependencies like device type, platform version or network connection
 * - Require and open our top-level UI component
 *
